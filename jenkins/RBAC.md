# From Grok
The error `hudson.security.AccessDeniedException3: anonymous is missing the Overall/Read permission` indicates that after switching to the **Role-Based Strategy** authorization in Jenkins, the anonymous user (or your current session) lacks the **Overall/Read** permission, preventing access to the Jenkins UI. This is a common issue when transitioning from a permissive mode (e.g., "Anyone can do anything" or "Logged-in users can do anything") to **Role-Based Strategy**, as the anonymous user or your admin user may not have the necessary permissions assigned. Since you're running Jenkins in a Docker container, I'll provide a step-by-step solution to resolve this issue and ensure you can successfully configure **Role-Based Strategy** for project-specific permissions.

### Why This Happens
- When you switch to **Role-Based Strategy**, Jenkins no longer allows anonymous or unauthenticated users to access the UI unless explicitly granted permissions.
- If your admin user or the anonymous user lacks the **Overall/Read** permission, you get locked out of the UI, resulting in the error you encountered.
- The error log timestamp (2025-06-02 17:44:53.447+0000) confirms this issue occurred recently, likely when you attempted to enable **Role-Based Strategy**.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

#### Step 1: Temporarily Disable Security to Regain Access
To bypass the lockout, you can temporarily disable security in the Jenkins configuration file (`config.xml`) within the Docker container.

1. **Access the Jenkins Container**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container_name> bash
   ```
   Replace `<container_name>` with your Jenkins container name or ID (find it using `docker ps`).

2. **Backup the Configuration File**:
   - Navigate to the Jenkins home directory:
     ```bash
     cd /var/jenkins_home
     ```
   - Create a backup of `config.xml`:
     ```bash
     cp config.xml config.xml.bak
     ```

3. **Disable Security**:
   - Edit `config.xml` using a text editor (e.g., `nano` or `vi`):
     ```bash
     nano config.xml
     ```
   - Locate the `<useSecurity>` tag and change it to:
     ```xml
     <useSecurity>false</useSecurity>
     ```
   - Save and exit the editor.

4. **Restart Jenkins**:
   - Restart the container to apply changes:
     ```bash
     docker restart <container_name>
     ```
   - Access the Jenkins UI (e.g., `http://<your-docker-host>:8080`). You should now have full access without authentication.

#### Step 2: Reconfigure Role-Based Strategy Properly
Once you regain access, configure **Role-Based Strategy** correctly to avoid the error.

1. **Install or Verify Role-Based Strategy Plugin**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins** > **Installed**.
   - Ensure the **Role-Based Strategy** plugin is installed and enabled. If not, install it from the **Available** tab and restart Jenkins if prompted.

2. **Enable Role-Based Strategy**:
   - Navigate to **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure Global Security**.
   - Under **Authorization**, select **Role-Based Strategy**.
   - Ensure **Authentication** is set appropriately (e.g., **Jenkins’ own user database** or your preferred method like LDAP).
   - Save changes. This may log you out, so ensure you know your admin credentials.

3. **Configure Roles and Permissions**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage and Assign Roles**.
   - **Create a Global Role for Admin**:
     - In **Manage Roles**, create a global role named `admin`.
     - Grant all permissions, including **Overall/Read** and **Overall/Administer**.
     - Save the role.
   - **Assign the Admin Role**:
     - In **Assign Roles**, assign the `admin` role to your admin user (e.g., `admin`).
     - If your admin user isn’t listed, ensure it exists in **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Users**, or create it.
   - **Create Project-Specific Roles** (as per your goal):
     - In **Manage Roles**, under **Project Roles**, create roles like:
       - **Role**: `projectA_builder`, **Pattern**: `^ProjectA.*`, **Permissions**: **Job/Build**, **Job/Read**.
       - **Role**: `projectA_viewer`, **Pattern**: `^ProjectA.*`, **Permissions**: **Job/Read**.
     - Save the roles.
   - **Assign Project Roles**:
     - In **Assign Roles**, assign project roles to specific users (e.g., `user1` gets `projectA_builder`).
   - **Optional: Anonymous User Permissions**:
     - If you want anonymous users to have limited access (e.g., view public jobs), create a global role like `anonymous` with **Overall/Read** and assign it to the `anonymous` user. However, for security, it’s better to restrict anonymous access.

4. **Re-enable Security**:
   - Edit `config.xml` again:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it <container_name> bash
     nano /var/jenkins_home/config.xml
     ```
   - Set `<useSecurity>true</useSecurity>`.
   - Save and exit.

5. **Restart Jenkins**:
   ```bash
   docker restart <container_name>
   ```

6. **Test Access**:
   - Log in as the admin user to verify you have full access.
   - Log in as a non-admin user to confirm they can only view or build specific projects as per their assigned roles.
